At this time, its in planning and hopes to deliver features that will work across the following digital assistants:

## Projected features

We would like to support the following interactions:

+ __Play the latest episode__ 
  + _Start the latest episode available from the podcast feed_
+ __When was the last time GUEST/SEGMENT was on__ 
  + _Return the date of the episode GUEST/SEGMENT was last on_
  + _Prompt if that episode should be played, if timestamp available, from the time the guest segment started_
+ __When was the first time GUEST/SEGMENT was on__
  + _Return the date of the episode GUEST/SEGMENT was first on_
  + _Prompt if that episode should be played, if timestamp available, from the time the guest segment started_  

We should also support the ability to ask questions about common memes on the show and play either the "ask the show" segment where it is explained, or play the segment where the meme was introduced.
